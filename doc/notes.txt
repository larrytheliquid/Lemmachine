Upon receipt of a media type with an unrecognized parameter, a user
agent should treat the media type as if the unrecognized parameter and
its value were not present.

content-encoding & media-type only with message-body

If an HTTP/1.0 server receives a Simple-Request, it must respond with
an HTTP/0.9 Simple-Response

An HTTP/1.0 client capable of receiving a Full-Response should never
generate a Simple-Request

An entity consists of Entity-Header fields and (usually) an
Entity-Body.

TODO: request entity header fields apply to response if no body?

Any HTTP/1.0 message containing an entity body should include a
Content-Type header field defining the media type of that body.

If the media type remains unknown, the recipient should treat it as
type "application/octet-stream".

Therefore, HTTP/1.0 requests containing an entity body must include a
valid Content-Length header field.

A valid Content-Length is required on all HTTP/1.0 POST requests. An
HTTP/1.0 server should respond with a 400 (bad request) message if it
cannot determine the length of the request message's content.

If an If-Modified-Since header field is included with a HEAD request, it should be ignored.

The Allow header field is not permitted in a request using the POST
method, and thus should be ignored if it is received as part of a POST entity.

TODO: so maybe in general things that should be ignored when received
are not allowed when sent?

TODO: does Allow description imply only post can have an entity in a
request?

Full-Request and Full-Response messages may transfer an entity within
some requests and responses.

The semantics of the GET method changes to a "conditional GET" if the
request message includes an If-Modified-Since header field.

The presence of an entity body in a request is signaled by the
inclusion of a Content-Length header field in the request message
headers.

If a Content-Length header field is present, its value in bytes
represents the length of the Entity-Body.

Therefore, HTTP/1.0 requests containing an entity body must include a
valid Content-Length header field.

An entity body is included with a request message only when the
request method calls for one.

If-Modified-Since:
A date which is later than the server's current time is invalid.

If a prior request has been authorized, the same credentials may be
reused for all other requests within that protection space for a
period of time determined by the authentication scheme, parameters,
and/or user preference.

Me: so auth can be dependent on previously successful auth and given
still obeying a responded time period

Me: Look more closely at Authentication details wrt history

TODO: re-check section 3

Upon receipt of a media type with an unrecognized parameter, a user
agent should treat the media type as if the unrecognized parameter and
its value were not present.

Use of non-registered media types is discouraged.

Note: Applications are encouraged to be tolerant of bad or misinformed
implementations of the Expires header. A value of zero (0) or an
invalid date format should be considered equivalent to an "expires
immediately." Although these values are not legitimate for HTTP/1.0, a
robust implementation is always desirable.

An origin server must not send a Last-Modified date which is later
than the server's time of message origination. In such cases, where
the resource's last modification would indicate some time in the
future, the server must replace that date with the message origination date.

Applications must not cache responses to a POST request because the
application has no way of knowing that the server would return an
equivalent response on some future request.


A valid Content-Length field value is required on all HTTP/1.0 request
messages containing an entity body.


A SubString may need to be strict to be useful, although we can
jump out and back into simple types internally

Between could just be a HEADERS where they are read until CRLFCRLF

specific types for optional vs required headers

Somewhere needs an "upto", e.g. CRLFCRLF
